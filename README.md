## Short description

The objective of this project is to create a functional password generator. Relying on user inputs to various options a password will be generated for the user to use for their own personal needs. My aim is to make the generator easy to understand and use with minimal user interaction besides just a few choices to make the perfect password for the user.

In this day and age having a non generated and/or easy password can be a mistake, password security is essential to prevent foul play. This password generator can create very strong passwords depending on what the user selects.
